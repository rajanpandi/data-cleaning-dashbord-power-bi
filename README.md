1. Data Cleaning
Objective: Ensure the integrity and quality of the data across five CSV files.
Process: For each CSV file, you likely handle missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates or irrelevant information. This step is crucial to avoid errors and inconsistencies during later stages.
2. Column Identification and Merging
Objective: Integrate data from multiple sources into a single, cohesive dataset.
Process: After cleaning, you identify columns that are related across the different files. These might include unique identifiers, dates, or other key fields. You then merge the data using Pandas, creating a comprehensive dataset that combines information from all the original files. This step is essential for providing a complete view of the data.
3. Data Storage with AWS and Python
Objective: Securely store the merged data in a structured format that supports analysis and reporting.
Process: Using AWS and Python, you push the cleaned and merged data into a MySQL database. This involves creating a connection between your local environment and the MySQL server, likely using SQLAlchemy or a similar library. Storing the data in MySQL allows for efficient querying and integration with other tools like Power BI.
4. Dashboard Creation with Power BI
Objective: Visualize the data to extract insights and support decision-making.
Process: Using the data stored in MySQL, you create a Power BI dashboard. This dashboard is designed to highlight key trends, patterns, and assumptions relevant to the company. It serves as a powerful tool for presentations and future business strategy, offering stakeholders a clear, visual understanding of the data.
